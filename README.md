# Automatic-Music-Generation-Using-Deep-Learning

  As the name suggests, this project is about generating musing using Deep Learning. Two approaches were used. One is using .midi files for generating the music for that I used the LSTM model and WaveNet both but WaveNet gave better results. A piano music tone was generated in this project. For handling Music Data Music21 library was used.
